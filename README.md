This Power BI dashboard visualizes all space missions since the beginning of the Space Race in 1957 up to August 7, 2020.

This [dashboard](https://github.com/AndreaMaratova/space_missions/blob/main/space_missions.pbix) is based on data from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957). ðŸš€

_In 1977, NASA launched the Voyager mission, sending two spacecraftâ€”Voyager 1 and Voyager 2â€”on a groundbreaking journey to explore the outer reaches of our Solar System and beyond. Both probes carry a remarkable artifact: a golden record, designed as a time capsule of Earth's culture, sounds, and location in the universe. This record includes greetings in multiple languages, natural sounds from our planet, and even music, such as Chuck Berry's iconic Johnny B. Goode._

_This choice inspired a humorous theory suggesting that if aliens ever replied, their message might be: "Send more Chuck Berry." Or perhaps, as Marty McFly once said, "Theyâ€™re not ready for this one yet." Well, who knows?_
